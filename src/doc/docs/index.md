# Welcome!

This documentation was powered by [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [squidfunk/mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Through this documentation I will guide you through my proposed solution to the code challenge develop a monitoring service.

For instructions on how to run the service please follow the README.md file in the project root.
